### Iâ€™m currently looking for 
Currently, I am actively searching for new opportunities and immersing myself in the process of applying for interviews. Simultaneously, I'm also engaged in interview preparations, refining my skills, and staying updated with the latest industry trends.

My expertise lies in front-end development, where I have honed my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Over the years, I have gained significant experience working with frameworks and libraries like React.js and Next.js, enabling me to build dynamic and interactive user interfaces. However, my curiosity and passion extend beyond the front end. I'm eager to explore the realms of backend development and dive into the fascinating world of databases, particularly MongoDB.

With this broader scope in mind, I'm excited to embark on the path of becoming a full-stack developer. I find immense fulfillment in crafting seamless user experiences while also having a deep understanding of the underlying backend processes. As such, I am open to opportunities in both front-end and back-end roles, as they align with my strong skill set and desire for continuous growth.
